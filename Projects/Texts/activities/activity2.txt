From the ages 9 to 14, I had been running in the Parkrun. Parkrun is a 5k run that happens weekly on Saturdays, or for the kids, a 2k on Sunday. Its a great way to meet other fellow runners and try to beat each other in a laid back, relaxed way.

When I started Parkrun, I wanted to get sub-25 mins 5k, from my times of around 30 minutes for a 5k. And so I would attend Parkrun weekly, and over the course of a couple years I knocked that time down to about 21 minutes, smashing my target and improving my fitness greatly.
