From the ages 9 to 14, I had been running in the Parkrun. Parkrun is a 5k run that happens weekly on Saturdays, or for the kids, a 2k on Sunday. Its a great way to meet other fellow runners and try to beat each other in a laid back, relaxed way.

When I started Parkrun, I wanted to get sub-25 mins 5k, from my times of around 30 minutes for a 5k. And so I would attend Parkrun weekly, and over the course of a couple years I knocked that time down to about 21 minutes, smashing my target and improving my fitness greatly.

Additionally, I volunteered at Parkrun for about 3 months, doing tasks such as timing runners, logging people on and marshalling. This proved to be a very enriching experience, as I would wake up at 7:30 on Saturdays, rain or shine, and be able to talk and meet many of the parkrunners after or whilst the run.

Additionally, as I didn't know how to do the tasks that I was volunteering for, I was being taught how to time, how to marshal and other volunteering task, every time I went out to Parkrun.

As a whole, I am happy that I volunteered for Parkrun as I feel like I am giving back to the organisation that shaped me and more importantly, my mentality.
