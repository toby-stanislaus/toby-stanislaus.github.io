Welcome, I'm Toby Stanislaus, and currently I am 15 years old in Year 11 and I have 
made this website to show off my coding expertise and display my coding feats over 
the last year. 

I have decided to branch out from my default programming language of Python to make 
this website, having to use html, javascript and css combined to make the website 
you see in front of you as easy to use as it is well designed in style.

If you would look to the top of the web page, there are certain projects that I have 
done using HTML, Javascript and CSS, with Sailing-ML also including the Machine 
Learning in Python that I did recently.

Additionally, there is the 'Experience' tab at the top that will cite all of my Work 
Experience, Coding Experience and Activities that I have done.This part of the 
website was designed to act as my CV, and the rest of the website is an interactive 
way of showing evidenceof my coding capabilities.

(You can find my grades on the right of 'Activities')

I have worked very hard for this website,I hope you enjoy it!
