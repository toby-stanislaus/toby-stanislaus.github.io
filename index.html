Welcome, I'm Toby Stanislaus, and currently I am 15 years old in Year 11 and I have <br>made this website to show off my coding expertise and display my coding feats <br>over the last year. <br>
I have decided to branch out from my default programming language of Python <br>to make this website, having to use html, javascript and css combined to make the website <br>you see in front of you as easy to use as it is well designed in style.<br>
If you would look to the top of the web page, there are certain projects that I have done <br>using html, javascript and css, with Sailing-ML also including the machine learning in <br>Python that I did recently.<br>
Additionally, there is the 'Experience' tab at the top that will cite all of my Work Experience,<br>Coding Experience and Activities that I have done.This part of the website was <br>designed to act as my CV, and the rest of the website is an interactive way of showing evidence<br>of my coding capabilities.

I have worked very hard for this website,<br>I hope you enjoy it!
